# Brazilian-Higher-Education-Exploration
This study seeks to organize and develop a basic analysis of higher education data available for Brazilians public and private institutions. This is my first data science/exploration project using Python, therefore the analysis and codes showcased are far from being a repository of best practice. Any suggestions to improve this project are appreciated.

For better organization and comprehension, this study is divided in 3 parts:

Part 1 - Data Extraction: In dataextraction.ipynb, I bring a description of datasets used in the project, its sources and the path to download it. This post will be uploaded if future analysis demands new datasets.

Part 2 - Data Cleaning: In datacleaning.ipynb, data is cleaned and column names standardized. The main goal is to have a comparable panel data. with annual information for courses, students, and institutions in the last decade.

Part 3 - Data Analysis: The analysis is subdivided into 6 sections. The first section, dataanalysis1.ipynb, analysis the historical panorama of higher education growth in Brazil, especially in the last 10 years. 

Some important considerations:

- English is not my mother language. Sorry for the mistakes;

- Many (maybe most) code lines lack consistency, performance and efficiency. Did my best to conciliate productivity and code quality. Any suggestions to improve code lines are welcome;

- The Analysis and Data Cleaning only scratch a huge domain of possibilities.  Any author seeking to further this study fell free to contact me. I can also help with any translation issue and provide information for additional sources of data in Brazil.
