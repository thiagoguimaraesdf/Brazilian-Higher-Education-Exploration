# Brazilian-Higher-Education-Exploration
This study seeks to organize and develop a basic analysis of higher education data available for Brazilians public and private institutions. This is my first data science/exploration project using Python, therefore the analysis and codes showcased are far from being a repository of best practice. Any suggestions to improve this project are appreciated.
